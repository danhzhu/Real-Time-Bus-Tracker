# Real Time Bus Tracker
### Description
In this project we use the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. An animated marker is added on the map to highlight the bus routes.
### How to Run
After git clone this repo, open the index.html in a web browser (Chrome is preferred). Then you can click the button to view the stops
### Roadmap of future improvements
Future improvements include adding different routes and adding animation on the bus movements.
